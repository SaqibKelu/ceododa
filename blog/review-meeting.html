            <p>
             Doda, February 10-The Deputy Commissioner Doda, Sh. Harvinder Singh, IAS, today chaired a 
             comprehensive review meeting of the School Education Sector at the Conference Hall of the DC Office Complex, 
             Doda, to assess the overall performance, 
             preparedness, and progress of education-related initiatives in the district.</p>

            <p>
             The meeting was convened to review the physical and financial progress of ongoing 
             schemes and to ensure smooth functioning and readiness of schools ahead of their reopening after
              the winter break. During the meeting, the DC Doda reviewed the physical and financial status of the
               District Capex Budget 2025–26 as well as the UT Capex Budget 2025–26 and issued directions for the
              timely utilisation of funds and completion of all approved works within the stipulated timelines.</p>


            <p>
             The implementation status of key flagship programmes, including PM POSHAN and Samagra Shiksha, was discussed in
              detail, with emphasis laid on improving quality, coverage, transparency, and effective service delivery. 
              The Chair also took stock of ongoing teacher training programmes, stressing the 
             importance of continuous capacity building to enhance teaching standards and improve learning outcomes across
              government schools.
            </p>

            

            <p>
             Special focus was laid on strengthening student enrolment initiatives, with directions 
             to make sustained efforts to bring dropouts and out-of-school children back into the formal education system. 
             The DC emphasised the need for effective
              monitoring at zonal and institutional levels to ensure maximum enrolment and retention of students.</p>



            <p>
              Progress on ongoing civil works in schools was reviewed, and directions were issued to expedite all pending works and
               ensure their completion well before March 2026. The status of residential and support facilities was also assessed, 
               including the operationalisation of the Girls Hostel at Government Higher Secondary School Sinoo and the shifting of
               KGBV Thathri to its own designated building within the prescribed timeframe.
            </p>

            <p>
             Preparations for the reopening of schools after winter vacations were reviewed in detail. The Chair stressed 
             the need to ensure availability of basic facilities, sanitation, heating arrangements wherever required, functional 
             electrification, adequate teaching staff, and a district-wide cleanliness and preparedness drive to provide a safe,
              hygienic, and student-friendly environment. Directions were also issued to ensure that girls’ 
             toilet facilities are fully functional in all schools, with pending works to be completed on priority.
            </p>

            <p>
              The meeting also highlighted the importance of effective implementation and close monitoring of the Mid Day Meal scheme. 
              Zonal authorities were instructed to conduct regular
               inspections and submit month-wise action taken reports to ensure quality, transparency, and adherence to guidelines.
A detailed PowerPoint presentation on various aspects of school education in the district was made before the Chair.
 The Deputy Commissioner expressed satisfaction over the review after detailed deliberations and directed officers 
 to maintain close monitoring of all ongoing schemes and promptly address any gaps.
            </p>

            <p>
              The meeting was attended by the Joint Director Education Doda-Kishtwar-Ramban, Chief Planning Officer Doda, 
              Chief Education Officer Doda, Principal DIET Doda, Superintendent Engineer PWD (R&B) Circle Doda, District
